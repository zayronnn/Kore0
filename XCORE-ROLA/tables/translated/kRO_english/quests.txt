7444#What Avant was researching#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Avant was researching on the methods to extract the Orb's magic power. Since this is dangerous information, the research materials should immediately be returned to Kardui.#

7445#Avant's back#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Researched the force behind Avant's research on the Orb. The most likely culpril is Avant's sponsor, the chief of staff. Approach the chief of staff to reveal the truth.#
Talk with the chief of staff#

7446#Unfruitful conversation#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Talked with Shnayim the chief of staff, but nothing was gained. He states that he might also have been tricked by Avant. The chief of staff was actually upset that Kardui only increased the defenses surrounding the Orb.#
Report to Kardui#

7447#Dilemma surrounding the Orb#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Only confirmed the distrust toward Kardui's instead of revealing more about Avant's research. The chief of staff hoped that Kardui's judgment has not weakened, and asked that he would demonstrate it.#

Report to Kardui#

7450#Orb's lighting room#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Not sure why the chief of staff kept trying to lure me into the Orb's lighting room, but decided to go there even just to figure out why. Let's go along with what he wants for now.#
Hold hands with the chief of staff#

7451#Betrayal#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Everything is so confusing. The monster battled in the lighting room was not a subordinate of the King of Demons. They controlled me without my knowledge. Shnayim the chief of staff betrayed all!#
Report to Kardui#

7452#Find the chief of staff!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Shnayim the chief of staff, who was responsible for all these occurrences, has hidden his whereabouts. According to Hisie's sources, residual magic force was faintly felt in Bifrost.#

8025#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now you must inspect a pipe located near the large cauldrons of molten metal and report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8026#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The pipe you found is bloated and worn out from long durations of being overloaded with pressure. It's a wonder it hasn't exploded yet. Report your findings to Zelmeto.#

The superintendant refused to approve the increase in the Factory Repair budget. You'd better report the bad news to Zelmeto.#

Let's go to Viktor at the pub to ask for the exact ingredients of the adhesive.#

Ask Librarian Jekan if he has found the 1st squad's final mission's paper work. He has bad eyesight and is in need of a Magnifier and a Lantern.#
#

60724#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Librarian Jekan looks to be busy, perhaps I should just "read some documents" for awhile and then check on the shelves for until he figures out where I should check on the shelves for "The 3rd Platoon Records".#
#

60725#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Jekan will need a few items to make a copy of the records. 2 Slick Paper and 1 Oil Paper from Amatsu, 3 Feather of Birds from Morrocc, and 20 Blue Gems from Geffen.#
Bring these items to Jekan to make him finish the copy faster#

60726#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Your copy of the records has a weird search magic on it. To find specific info, you need to first check for broad topic then get more specific: crusader 3rd_company 3rd_platoon 1st_squad.#
Look up the individual members names to find out where they are nowadays#

60727#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Find Zan Huadoku inside the Geffen Blacksmith guild. Observe politeness when asking him how he is doing before jumping in to ask about their top secret final mission. Yeah, that's the ticket!#
#

60728#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zan Huadoku has told you all that you think is possible. You should head to Morrocc to find "Cuaque Donon" who was last seen at the Inn. You have a feeling that you may need to be stubborn in Morrocc.#
#

60729#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Cuaque Donon is in a Rogue Guild hideout probably at "Fortress Saint Darmain (South)" (use map ctrl + ~) The password to enter should be "Aragham never hoarded upgrade items".#
Cuaque is suffering from extreme PTSD and "freaks out" so pretending he is a young child would help, maybe even a dolly hahaha#

60730#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Cuaque said the squad found the "Megingjard" and an argument broke out... You need to know more about that argument, perhaps Jack.O in Alberta on the docks can help.#
He is still an active crusader, so I think talking to him will be much more straight forward#

60731#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Jack.O found some relief from "Green Herb". Perhaps I should pass that advice onto the other Crusaders I meet. Emma Searth is in Aldebaran, a quick boat to Izlude and a Kafra warp to Aldebaran will have me there in a jiffy!#
Maybe I should also contemplate a memory aid for these crusaders, something to help them remember their place like a "Bookclip" from a "Rideword"#

60732#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I think I need to hurry to see "The Nineball" he works as a bouncer in the Jawaii inn. I heard there is an ex-barkeep of Jawaii working in the Central Prontera Pub maybe he knows a way to get to Jawaii without tying the knot!#
Someone named Nineball and who is a bouncer probably is pretty closed mouth kinda guy, I should keep talking until he at least reacts to my questions..#

60733#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Exit Jawaii with a Butterflywing or drink yourself back to Rune-Midgarts. Get to Comodo to see "Royal Myst" at the south casino. Morrocc to Comodo is usually the easiest way to warp to Comodo.#
A "couple" of shots of "Alcohol" can loosen Royal Myst's tongue..#

60734#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You've spoken to all the crusaders that are still alive, apparently something happened, blame was passed and Crusader Egnigem died in the process. You should return to Prontera Castle and inform him of your findings.#
A kafra hop from Comodo to Morrocc to Prontera is quick unless you're saved in Prontera#

60735#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You should talk with the last member of the 1st squad, the late Egnigem. A Kafra hop from Prontera to Morrocc to Comodo then to Umbala and then a journey north to the Tree of Life to Nifflheim can get you to him.#
Listen to Egnigem and see what you can do to fix this#

60736#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
By Odin's mercy this is terrible, you never believed that a holy Crusader would do such an evil act to claim the power of Megingjard. Be brave and return to the Crusader Headquarters and tell Max Von Shedough what you know.#
#

60737#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Max Von Shedough has accepted my report, and is deeply troubled by its contents, but part of me truly believes that despite good intentions the political reality may intervene to keep justice from being had.#
I must tell Egnigem at least of the outcome, he deserves at least to know what he died for.#

60738#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Egnigem has blessed you with all his remaining strength. You have a feeling that there is one special someone that he would want to know his fate, You must tell Emma Searth about his fate.#
#

60739#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Emma can't Remember, but she can feel the loss. Your faith in Justice is weak now... You must tell Max Von Shedough he is the Judge and he should share this burden of guilt.#
