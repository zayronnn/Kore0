[Amatsu the Land of Destiny]
The people of Amatsu carry themselves with honor and tranquility.
During your visit, you should see the Beautiful ^ff0000Water Shrine^000000.  The ^ff0000Lords of Amatsu^000000 are much more open
compared to rulers in other lands, and they will talk to visitors and citizens alike.   
The ^ff0000Legendary Tree^000000 in Amatsu has spawned many legends, including the legend that when you propose under 
its branches, your marriage will be blessed.   
While in Amatsu, you should also visit the ^ff0000Coy Pond^000000, as the nobility of Amatsu keep wonderful gardens of plants, sand and rocks. 
Their careful balance and flow is reflected in their garden arrangements, and the garden keeper's state of mind.  
Part of the magnificent gardens includes Coy Pond, where the frolicsome fish are a delight to all. 
(Don't forget to take photos of all these things, and show them to your Tour Guide.)

[Kunlun The Hermit Land]				
Kunlun is a land in the clouds.  
Being so high in the air affords an unprecedented view of the world, and it also gives 
a different mindset to those who allow themselves to think freely.  
The ^ff0000Statue of Kunlun's Greatest Philosopher^000000 stands proudly in the middle of town, ready to
inspire great thought from all who gaze upon him.  All around Kunlun are spectacular ^ff0000Overlooks of the World^000000.  
But there are particular spots that are exceptionally breathtaking, please watch your step.
There is a ^ff0000small hill in Kunlun^000000 that is said to have been the Great Philosopher's favorite place for meditation; 
you should visit and see if any grand thoughts emerge from within.  
No matter how great a culture is, there will always be a few among its citizenry who just don't 'get it'. 
Those from Kunlun's history who thought small eventually shrank, and eventually disappeared.  
But before that time they had a ^ff0000Mini-town^000000 that they lived in under the ground beneath Kunlun.  
That place is an objective lesson against stagnant thinking.

[Louyang]				
Louyang is a spiritual country, where the warrior spirit and clear thinking are highly prized. 
Such wondrous sites such as the ^ff0000Statue of the Man and the Tiger^000000 may inspire you to do your best.
Louyang has a different perspective on healing the mind and the body.  While Rune Midgard relies on the science of potions 
and Faith for healing, the Louyang healers practice their art at a '^ff0000Hospital^000000'.  
At a Hospital, your body will be cured by a system of body manipulations and changes in diet.  
The beautiful ^ff0000Palace^000000 that is protected by the Great Wall of Louyang is truly a sight to behold for every visitor.  
To go along with their proud heritage of Martial Arts and spiritual training, they often practice making their bodies 
more durable through exercise. Some of these exercises target the legs and lungs.  
Outside Louyang, some practice their ^ff0000Shouting on the Tower^000000.  When you have seen all these sites in Louyang,
you will have quite a few good memories to take home.

[Ayothaya]				
Thoughts of transcending your limitations, and finding Life's perfect philosophy, is Ayothaya's Heritage.  
In Ayothaya's history is a great Philosopher that all Ayothayans seek to emulate.  
There are numerous statues representing this Philosopher in and around Ayothaya.  
You should visit them to see what kind of significance these ^ff0000Reclining Philosopher Statues^000000 have for 	you.  
Part of the Philosophy involves many hours of meditation a day to maintain balance between the mind and body.  
You should visit the ^ff0000Shrine in Ayothaya^000000 and meditate upon your life's journey.  
And when you complete your regimen of Exercise and Introspection, you can refuel your body by visiting 
the ^ff0000Tom Yum Goon restaurant^000000.  The famous soup made here is truly delicious.  
Don't leave Ayothaya without sampling the dishes first.
